This famous British WWII-era phrase may have been rendered meaningless by [contemporary abuse](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/keep-calm-and-carry-on). But its literal message can still be revived as a mantra for... well, keeping calm and carrying on, with an accent on a particular application. I want to talk about **material loss**.

The fascists may not be bombing the UK anymore (for now) but things still break, decay, or get lost from time to time. When I say "things", I mean material items (a beloved book, an emotional memento, a childhood home), but also more abstract possessions grounded on physical media (the pictures in my phone, all my emails).

How we react to this kind of loss plays a larger role in our moods than we acknowledge. I want to illustrate three steps one may take through life regarding how to deal with this kind of loss.


## Courage

I'd dare to say we are mostly raised to care maybe a little bit too much about objects. Perhaps this is a necessary evil, so that people, as children, don't break or damage stuff.

The consequence of this is that it *hurts* to lose things. We grow attached to the dumbest objects: clothes, jewelry, paintings, records... for many various reasons. It may even be just the economic cost.

Thus, I'd say that, initially, detachment requires **courage**. The will not to get angry, sad, or both is a quality to be cultivated and not an easy one to attain, specially living inside the context of our day to day lives (a context that most of us can not just evade).

If a dish breaks, go sweep it. If you accidentally tear a page of one of your favorite books, just keep reading. If you realize you left your favorite jacket inside the train, get a new one.


## Cheerfulness

Here it gets a little bit harder. This requires having strong control over one's feelings. The idea is that getting rid of things should make one happy. Of course this is orders of magnitude easier said than done.

Throw away that old puzzle you've been putting off. Get rid of that sweater you never wear (even if that makes someone mad!) Delete those pesky vacation photos you're not going to look at ever again.

And **enjoy** the process. Seeing your tables and drawers regain that precious space will make you smile. And not having to care where you left this or who took that will free your mind a tiny little bit, just like a to-do list getting shorter and shorter. In fact, I sometimes feel like the imaginary list of my belongings acts like a list that occupies computing power of my brain.


## Resolution

I'm not trying to claim here that material things have no value or that we should get rid of as many of them as possible. Heck, *I* have lots of stuff around just cluttering my closets (and mind). I don't even think there's a categorical rule to how one should behave with regard to objects; every person and setting is different enough to deserve special consideration.

With this last point in mind, I propose an exercise. Maybe most people will never do something like this in their whole lives, but I think it's worth some days, maybe weeks, of your life, to pause and **ponder** what is the worth of the physical items in your life. Not the ones you currently own, but the idea of physical ownership in general.

You *can* plan ahead how you feel about certain things. Or at least you can try. How will you react when the car you love just can't run another kilometer? My proposal is that you devote as much time as necessary to this. And I'm pretty sure that, if most people did this, they'd realize that they don't really care about things as much as the momentum of life can make one feel. After all, the easiest way to avoid negative feelings when losing things, is not to care about them.
