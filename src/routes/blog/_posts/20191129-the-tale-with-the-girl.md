I once met this strange girl on the street, the popular-looking, obnoxious kind. She didn't seem to care for me much. The specifics of our exchange are not too important. I was told that I wouldn't survive this life, that I wasn't bright enough. Funnily enough, the detail I most clearly remember about her is that she didn't, in fact, look too smart herself.

But with time, teen years are gone and the passage of time starts to speed up. And I kept thinking about that awkward conversation. I realized that the constraints of society, like the ones she tried to impose on me, were too heavy. They made me fall down. And so, it all reached a point where I just stopped pursuing the life of responsibilities that I had in mind for myself, and just started playing life for entertainment's sake. This realization made me see what, among other things in society, the education system actually entailed: stuffing facts into your brain without really acquiring any real knowledge.

But life isn't about that: it's about travel, about food, about sex, about songs and dance... And, if in order to live your best life, you have to avoid the appointed path that the world wants you to follow, then go on! Be free! The only way to find out is to actually take the power into your hands and let your light out.

I'll say this as many times as needed: every person should be able to feel like a celebrity. Like an NBA hero or a music legend, and if you seem to have any potential inside, then you are really capable of being the next Lebron or Ringo.

Life will not get any easier with time. And so the best moment to seize the day (or decade) is today, even if people dare to tell you otherwise. If you feel like you're on the verge of falling into deep water, take the leap. You won't drown, because you are made of fire.

What I'm trying to say is, you too are an [all star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_jWHffIx5E).
