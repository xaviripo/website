Iberian tradition has it that, upon its killing on Saint Martin's day, no part of the pig's body shall go to waste. From the snout to the tail, every bowel, leg, and bone can be given a use.

Not far off, every part of life is profitable. Working, studying, exercising, or even eating all have their function within the time puzzle that each day becomes through the years.

A nap too long, a sleazy wake-up, a day of rest, they're all like leaving pork to rot under the sun. What's to gain from just sitting there?

As children, we're often told the fable of the three little pigs, urging us to strive for the third pig's morals. After the little wolf incident, though, life goes on.


## The Third Pig

The third pig had the biggest and strongest house of them all. It had a basement with a foosball and a pool table. He had two mortgages and worked extra hours to pay for his new car. He died of coronary disease at the ripe-old age of 10 years (amounting to about 54 years for a human).


## The Second Pig

The second pig had formed a family with his wife and three beautiful piglets. His workplace allowed him to leave early on Fridays (once met the requirement he had worked those 2 hours previously). He began taking painting lessons once a week. His deathbed regret was not having spent enough time with his children.


## The First Pig

The first pig was hardly ever heard of by his two brothers. He usually worked part time and changed jobs every 6 months or so. He had lived in five different countries and had played for a state-class football team. He never got to feel the immense pride of being a home owner, nor did he know the warm love of a close family.


It would be tempting to sort the three pigs by their morals. One could say that the third pig was the most virtuous one, because he worked hard throughout his whole life. Some would state that the second pig was the most fortunate, for he lived surrounded by those that loved him the most. Maybe more than a few people would look up to the third pig for breaking free and living his dreams.

But judging these three animals by the paths they took is a step still ahead of me, and, as I see it, ahead of most of us. We often see ourselves in the future, and dream of riches, love, or adventure. Yet there's no future ahead, there's only the step we take every day. As Machado perfectly put it, (and allow me to butcher his poem by translating it):

> Walker, there's no road,
> the road is made upon walking.

I feel it's okay to want either path. It's okay not to know which one to pick. And, most importantly, it's okay to admit you made the wrong choice at any time.
