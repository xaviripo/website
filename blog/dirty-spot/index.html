I was so ashamed, to think that I'd have to hand in something so ugly and unkempt. It gave me horrible anxiety, I remember it being my only worry at the time.</p> <p>I forgot how it all turned out. But I think that's a good sign: the worry ended up weighting more than the eventual resolution itself.</p> <p>That is my point: most of the times, we remember better the suffering that keeping the issue in our mind brought, than the consequences that it entailed.
