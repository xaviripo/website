I don't even think there's a categorical rule to how one should behave with regard to objects; every person and setting is different enough to deserve special consideration.</p> <p>With this last point in mind, I propose an exercise. Maybe most people will never do something like this in their whole lives, but I think it's worth some days, maybe weeks, of your life, to pause and <strong>ponder</strong> what is the worth of the physical items in your life. Not the ones you currently own, but the idea of physical ownership in general.</p> <p>You <em>can</em> plan ahead how you feel about certain things. Or at least you can try. How will you react when the car you love just can't run another kilometer? My proposal is that you devote as much time as necessary to this. And I'm pretty sure that, if most people did this, they'd realize that they don't really care about things as much as the momentum of life can make one feel. After all, the easiest way to avoid negative feelings when losing things, is not to care about them.</div></main> <footer class="bg-light navbar navbar-light sticky-bottom svelte-cd7jx7"><div class="svelte-cd7jx7 text-center">© 2020 Xavier Ripoll</div></footer> </div></div> <script>__SAPPER__={baseUrl:"",preloaded:[void 0,null,{post:{html:"\u003Cp\u003EThis famous British WWII-era phrase may have been rendered meaningless by \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fknowyourmeme.com\u002Fmemes\u002Fkeep-calm-and-carry-on\"\u003Econtemporary abuse\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.
