This famous British WWII-era phrase may have been rendered meaningless by [contemporary abuse](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/keep-calm-and-carry-on). But its literal message can still be revived as a mantra for... well, keeping calm and carrying on, with an accent on a particular application. I want to talk about **material loss**.

The fascists may not be bombing the UK anymore (for now) but things still break, decay, or get lost from time to time. When I say "things", I mean material items (a beloved book, an emotional memento, a childhood home), but also more abstract possessions grounded on physical media (the pictures in my phone, all my emails).

How we react to this kind of loss plays a larger role in our moods than we acknowledge.
