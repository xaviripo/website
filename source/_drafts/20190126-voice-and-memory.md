This text is a short portrait of my feelings on the intersection of two interesting topics, both related to the way our brains work.

## The voice

Do you hear a voice inside your head that reads your thoughts?

Okay, maybe that was too much to begin with. What about this: when you read, do you hear the sounds of the words inside your head?

If your answer is "I'm not sure", chances are you don't. Or so claimed one of the co-hosts of the podcast [Hello Internet](http://www.hellointernet.fm/) as he posed this same question to his mate in an episode back in 2015 ([episode 51](http://www.hellointernet.fm/podcast/51), around the 1:44:10 mark).

The act of internally voicing the information that travels through your consciousness is called [subvocalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subvocalization). Although the term is typically applied to speaking internally while reading, it can be extended to encompass the act of representing any ideas as speech in your head.

I can clearly visualize the moment I was listening to this episode of the podcast. It was about three years ago; I was taking a stroll by myself in Barcelona downtown. I remember, back then, having a specific (albeit unclear) answer to whether or not I subvocalized: "I kind of do now, but I remember I didn't use to".

## Down the rabbit hole

This is where we dive into dangerous territory: memories.
